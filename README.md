# 📊 Data-Driven Sales Optimization & B2B Forecasting for Naadul Milk Company  

## 🚀 Executive Summary  
This project delivers **data-driven strategies** for **Naadul Milk Company**, a dairy business operating in both **B2B (cafes, retail shops, institutions)** and **B2C (direct customers)** segments.  

The primary focus is on:  
- **Forecasting B2B Order Patterns** to improve demand planning & inventory management.  
- **Optimizing Product Mix & Profitability** across B2B and B2C segments to maximize margins.  

By combining **statistical analysis, time-series forecasting, and profitability modeling**, this project translates raw sales data into **actionable insights for revenue growth, cost optimization, and strategic decision-making**.

## ❓ Problem Statements  

### 1. B2B Order Pattern Forecasting  
- Bulk buyers (cafes, retail shops, institutions) show fluctuating demand.  
- Lack of reliable forecasting → leads to **overproduction, wastage, or stockouts**.  
- **Need**: A robust forecasting model to predict **bulk order trends** and enable efficient production planning.  

### 2. Product Mix & Profitability Optimization  
- Naadul offers multiple products: **Milk, Paneer, Dahi, Ghee**.  
- Revenue heavily skewed towards **Milk & Paneer**, while high-margin products (like **Ghee**) remain underutilized.  
- **Need**: A **data-backed strategy** to identify the **ideal product mix** and balance between **B2B & B2C** channels.

## 🛠️ Approach & Methodology  

### 🔹 Data Collection & Cleaning  
- Compiled sales and B2B transaction data, including product-wise quantities, revenues, and buyer details.  

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized **demand trends, buyer segments, and seasonal fluctuations**.  
- Identified **high-value buyers** and **most profitable product categories**.  

### 🔹 Forecasting Techniques  
- Applied **time-series analysis** (trend + seasonality) for B2B order prediction.  
- Evaluated models (**ARIMA, Prophet, regression**) for demand forecasting.  

### 🔹 Profitability & Mix Optimization  
- Calculated **contribution margins** for each product.  
- Recommended product allocations to maximize **net profitability** while minimizing risk.

## 📈 Key Insights & Results  

### 🔹 B2B Demand Forecasting  
- Achieved reliable forecasts for **bulk buyer orders**, improving planning accuracy.  
- Potential reduction of **15–20% wastage** by aligning production with predicted demand.  

### 🔹 Product Mix Optimization  
- **Milk & Paneer** = volume drivers, but low margins.  
- **Ghee & Dahi** = profitability boosters, but under-promoted.  
- Recommended **reallocation strategy**: Increase Ghee & Dahi in B2C, while stabilizing Milk & Paneer in B2B.  

### 🔹 Revenue Growth Potential  
- By rebalancing product mix and focusing on high-value bulk buyers, Naadul could achieve **10–12% profit uplift** without increasing production costs.
